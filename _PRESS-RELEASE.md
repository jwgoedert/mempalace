There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## memoryPal ##
  > memPal or memoryPal is a card deck memorization aid which uses the "Person-Object-Action" system of memorization.

## The YOU. ##
  > This software is designed for anyone looking to improve their memory, but most especially beginners familiar with the "POA" technique of card deck memorization looking for an aid.
## Summary ##
  > This was inspired by the book 'Moonwalking With Einstein' by Joshua Foer.  Mental athletes use a system of memorizing a Person, object, and action per card in order to visually recall cards via bizarre pointers in memory. This system allows you to remember three cards at a time and place their  combination in spatial memory in order to better recall. It proves that memory, or 'memorizing' can be learned and practiced. This is an aid for beginners and advanced students alike to start their path toward memorization and mental excercise enjoyment.   
## Why do you need a memory app? ##
  > Memorizing decks of cards, although second nature once practiced can be daunting at the forefront as the system for doing so needs to be constantly altered and revisited. This software allows an alternative to the stacks of notecards and discarded spreadsheets.  

## How it works ##
  > memPal keeps a database of People, objects, and actions for dynamically creating your list, and also lets one dynamically input their own from start to finish making sure there are no duplicates.  

## Words from the creator ##
  > A mind not worked is like a canoe on land.

## Getting started ##
  > Open up the app and hit "create new deck" or begin inputting your own. Inputs from you and previous users will go into making the decks of future users, so please make them memorable and well known! 

## Customer Quote ##
  >  I memorized a deck of cards in 15 seconds with memPal... Thanks memPal!
## What are you waiting for? ##
  > Get off, or stay on... your couch, this app will help, but there's still work to be done, most estimates say a strong morning before being able to memorize your first deck.  Get started!
